# Typescript experiment

This project is set up as an experimental playground to work with Typescript.
No buildm manager was used, as another small experiment. Npm scripts are the tool to use.

* Run `npm run tslint` to run the linter.
* Run `npm run tcs` to compile the typescript.

_If you want to have some silent output (for CI maybe?), then append `-s` to the script: `npm run tcs -s`_
